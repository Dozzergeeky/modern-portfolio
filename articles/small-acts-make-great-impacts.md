When I moved to Los Angeles three years ago, I was the only Brazilian at the office. I spent the first year only working with people from different cultures until another Brazilian came. I felt very lonely but learned a lot from that experience.

At the office we have music in the bathrooms and free drinks in the gameroom. One day I went to the bathroom and it was playing Bossa Nova. Other day I went to the gameroom and found some Guaran√°.

These may sound like very small things but when you're away from your country they mean a LOT.

If you're working in a multi-culture office, try to create these kind of experiences for your coworkers. I'm sure they will appreciate you more than you think.

Small acts make great impacts.
