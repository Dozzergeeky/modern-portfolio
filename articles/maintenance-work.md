Have you ever noticed how much of maintenance work we do in our lives?

Every year we have to do our taxes, go to the doctor, etc. Every month we have cut our hair, pay our bills, etc. Every week we have wash our clothes, clean the house, etc. Every day we have to brush our teeth, do some work, eat something, etc.

We all do these kind of activities and, even though this is not even the complete list, we often forget how time consuming they can be. We just do them because that's what society expects from us.

What about creative work? Remember that day when you stopped everything and tried to build something new?

We need more of those moments, we need to challenge the status quo more, we need to make sure that who controls our time is us, not someone else.
