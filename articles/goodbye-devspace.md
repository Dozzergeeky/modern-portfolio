In January 2016, I wrote a [blog post to announce my new side project](/the-problems-with-githubs-news-feed/), a TweetDeck for GitHub, called DevSpace.

At that time, I believed that GitHub was missing the potential social aspect of the platform and maybe I could help with this little tool.

Along the way, lots of amazing people (like _you_) started to use the app. Bugs were reported, improvements were made, but I was never able to properly dedicate time to maintain this project.

A few weeks ago I got a message about another person who was pursuing that same idea, so I decided it was time to discontinue DevSpace.

While it's sad to say goodbye to DevSpace, I'm eager to use [DevHub](https://devhubapp.com/) and follow its future. You shouldn't miss any functionality and you'll be surprised by the other cool things it can do.
