As reported by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/18/developer-focused-email-platform-resend-raises-3m/) and [PEGN](https://revistapegn.globo.com/startups/noticia/2023/07/resend-capta-us-3-milhoes-em-rodada-seed-com-y-combinator-e-investidores-anjo.ghtml) today, Resend just raised a $3M seed round.

I wanted to take a moment to share Resend's vision for how we’re redefining email sending, and our mission to provide the ultimate developer experience.

## We're growing fast

Since launching in January, over 10,000 developers have signed up to Resend. We've sent over 7 million transactional emails, and we're just getting started.

Resend is already quietly powering some of the fastest growing companies. They're building everything from a [platform for artists to tell their story](https://resend.com/customers/layer) to an [investment product with data sourced from Nasdaq and S&P](https://resend.com/customers/fey).

Our open source project, [React Email](https://react.email), just crossed 8,000 stars on GitHub, it has more than 80 contributors, and it's used by teams of all sizes.

Today we're also launching the [Resend Discord](https://resend.com/discord) to connect our community of developers.

## Our investors

To help us scale demand, we partnered with **Y Combinator** who funded 90+ billion dollar companies like Stripe, Airbnb, Docker, and many others.

We're also thrilled to have participation from **SV Angel** who backed world-class companies like GitHub, Slack, and OpenAI.

<blockquote>
  "I'm so excited to be involved with Resend! Developer experience is so important to build better products, and historically, that DX in building email has been... awful. I can't wait for that to change, and Resend is going to make it happen!"

For this seed round, we intentionally focused on raising money from founders and operators. Chances are you are already using the products they helped to create.

- **Dylan Field** (founder of Figma)
- **Guillermo Rauch** (founder of Vercel)
- **Calvin French-Owen** (founder of Segment)
- **Michael Grinich** (founder of WorkOS)
- **Paul Copplestone** (founder of Supabase)
- **David Cramer** (founder of Sentry)

As well as individual investors like **Elad Gil**, **Lachy Groom**, and **Alana Goyal**.

## Where we're going

We're building a communications platform, and we're starting with email.

When you look at all the biggest competitors in this space, you'll notice that they were all founded around 2009/2010, and they all have been acquired by now.

Because of that, it's common to see them only prioritizing enterprise requirements and optimizing for sales-led growth.

Nobody is building an exceptional developer experience. Nobody is trying to innovate. There isn’t a single developer-first email platform in the market today. We want to change that.

We need to stop developing emails like 2010 and rethink how email can be done in 2023 and beyond. Email development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build apps today.

Over the next couple months, we'll double-down on this vision and expand the way you can use Resend to communicate with your users.
