## Why am I doing this?

When I was a CPO at [Liferay Cloud](https://liferay.com), I faced the problem of sending emails at scale.

We had high-profile customers complaining about deliverability, and I've been frustrated with existing services ever since.

More recently, as a VP of Developer Experience at [WorkOS](https://workos.com), I once again had to deal with emails landing in the spam folder. 

After looking at all the different solutions out there, I've been obsessed with the idea of solving this problem once and for all.

We first launched [react.email](https://react.email) to help developers write modern email templates.

As I started to dig deeper, it became clear that this was just the tip of the iceberg.

Sending emails is the biggest pain point, so we started to explore something new.

## What problem are we solving?

We're building a communications platform, and we're starting with email.

The idea is for you to send messages with easy-to-use APIs/SDKs without having to worry about emails going to the spam folder.

Think of it as a next-generation Sendgrid.

## Why now?

When you look at all the biggest competitors, you'll notice that they were all founded around 2009/2010, and they all have been acquired by now.

Because of that, it's common to see them only prioritizing enterprise requirements and optimizing for sales-led growth.

Nobody is building an exceptional developer experience. Nobody is trying to innovate.

There isnâ€™t a single developer-first email platform in the market today. We want to change that.

We need to stop developing emails like 2010 and rethink how email can be done in 2023 and beyond.

Email development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build apps today.
