After years using the same layout for jQuery Boilerplate, I've decided to completely
redesign it. The main reason was to point people not only for
[jQuery Boilerplate](https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate) project,
but also to its [Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/generator-jquery-boilerplate)
and [jQuery Patterns](https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-patterns) project.

Check it out at [jqueryboilerplate.com](http://jqueryboilerplate.com/)!
