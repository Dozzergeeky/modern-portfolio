December and January are exciting months. For most people, it's a time to reflect on what they achieved and to plan what they want next. That's no different for me.

I started this year thinking about all the flaws I have. The list was big, but one topic that came up constantly was that **I'm a very intense person**. When I have an idea, I stop everything and start executing it as fast as I can.

That's not necessarily a bad thing. Creating things makes me happy - it's part of who I am. But as you know, anything in excess generates side effects. For me, this was affecting my sleep, my diet, and my ability to focus on what really matters.

> It was clear that I needed to make some changes, so in January, I decided to pick a theme for my entire year - consistency.

## Side Projects

I always loved to create things for developers; that was my safe zone. But this year, I tried to [challenge myself](/trying-something-new/) to create something for the consumer market and [build a native mobile app](https://lecheese.app), something I've never done before.

As I said before, I'm an intense person, so in less than three weeks, I already had a MVP launched on both [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/le-cheese/id1449930676) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lecheese.app). The challenge here was to keep the momentum going.

> I had forced myself to work a few hours every day instead of a few days for long hours. That was really hard, there were some days when I just wanted to keep going, but I reminded myself to stop and go to sleep.

The result - the app went from 0 to 5,694 downloads (3,313 App Store / 2,380 Play Store). From those downloads, I was able to capture 2,155 registered users. More importantly, I was able to release 76 versions on each platform, an average of 6 releases per month.

## Day to day Job

This year I completed seven years working at [Liferay](https://www.liferay.com). In tech land, this looks like an eternity, but it feels like it's just the beginning.

We had so many challenges that I don't even know where to start, but if I could pick, I'd say that [saying goodbye to WeDeploy](/discontinuing-wedeploy/) was the hardest one.

Discontinuing a product that you created is hard, but we knew this was the right thing to do. Once again, consistency is what made things easier.

> This time it was not about consistency in terms of personal habits; it was consistency in terms of decision-making.

We knew that DXP Cloud had a much bigger chance to succeed. Looking at the numbers now, I can say it was the best decision we could have made.

## Personal Health

People say you should never start a gym membership at the beginning of the year. Well, that's precisely what I did. The problem is that I always hated gyms, I tried many different times, and sooner or later I just stopped going.

I heard that CrossFit was different, so I decided to give it a try. I also started to run, something I never really liked to do. However, my behavior towards them were completely different than other times. Here's what changed:

- **When to go:** I used to go exercise during the night. If I had a more stressful day, the first thing I'd do was skipping workout. Instead, I tried to go at 6 am, before my day started for real. I had no excuse anymore, and that was liberating.
- **What to expect:** once you start going more often, your instant-gratification mind starts to ask you: _"Where's the result? Where's the result?"_. The thing is, it takes time to see any change in your body. To solve this, I try to shut up my brain and say to myself: _"Just trust the process, just trust the process."_
- **What to share:** for months, I didn't say a thing about my exercise routine. I could feel a complete change in my lifestyle, but I was trying to avoid telling people about that. The reason is that when you externalize a goal, we think we have accomplished already. A few months later, when I noticed that it was already part of my routine, I shared with friends what I was doing.

The result - I went from 185.6 lbs (84.2 kg) body weight to 164.5 lbs (74.6 kg).

## Your turn

I hope this article inspired you to focus on consistency, as well.

> Life is a marathon, and the only way to get to the finish line in a healthy and successful way is to be consistent.

Working hard is just one part of the puzzle.
