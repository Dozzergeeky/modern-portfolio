In January I mentioned that I was working on a little side project.

After several weeks in beta, this project is available for you to use!

ðŸ‘‰ [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/le-cheese/id1449930676)

ðŸ‘‰ [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lecheese.app)

The idea was simple - to create a native mobile app, something I've never done before.

You can think of this app as [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com/) or [Untappd](https://untappd.com/), but for cheese!

I don't have any crazy ambitions about this, I just love cheese and I love to create things, simple as that :)

Thank you so much for those who already tested and reviewed the app in the App Store and Play Store. For those who didn't download yet, go ahead and play around, I would love to get your feedback!
