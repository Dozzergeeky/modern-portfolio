Back in 2008, I was applying for different universities. I studied like crazy that year and finally got accepted in Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro.

After a looooot of thinking, I decided to study at [UTFPR (CEFET)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Technology_%E2%80%93_Paran%C3%A1) in Curitiba.

They gave us an entire week to register, but they organized by name (A-Z), so I could only register on Friday. I got all the documents they required and went there. A secretary reviewed everything and found that one document was missing!

I still had some time, so I ran to my high school to get that other document. When I finally got the missing document, I ran back to the university, but the registration window was over.

I was completely devastated. I cried myself to sleep that night. I couldn't believe that I was going to miss the opportunity to live close to my friends and family again.

There was no other option, so I had to study at [UNIRIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_the_State_of_Rio_de_Janeiro) in Rio de Janeiro.

Looking back, I can say that it was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. I was forced out of my home city into a whole new world.

> Sometimes we think that there's only one way to make us happy, that's not true. We can shape our future, and it doesn't matter where it is.

Your zip code doesn't need to dictate your happiness.
