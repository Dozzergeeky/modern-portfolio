Two years ago [Eduardo](https://twitter.com/eduardolundgren) and I decided to start something new.

At that time, we had built some popular libraries together and we thought we could try something more ambitious.

We didn’t know exactly what would that be, but we had a vision. We wanted to **create something that would make developers more productive.**

The thing is, we didn’t want to leave [Liferay](https://www.liferay.com) to pursue that vision, so we started to stay until late at the office and work on a prototype.

That prototype was called _Launchpad_, we showed it to some people internally and gained support to work more on it.

Few months later we validated with real users and we noticed that there were many pieces missing. The result was not what we were looking for.

So we sat down again, now with a more clear goal in mind. We came up with new features, new interface, and new branding.

We launched the first alpha version last year. We showed it at few exclusive Liferay conferences and got more than 1,000 users. Things were getting real.

Today we’re finally launching the beta version. Until now we were quiet about it, but now I can finally share publicly what I’ve been working on.

**Without further ado, I present you [WeDeploy](https://wedeploy.com).**

We want developers to dedicate their time to what really matters: building awesome apps. That's why we’re so excited for you to try this new platform.

You can use it in many different ways. You can deploy a [Node.js](https://wedeploy.com/docs/deploy/deploying-nodejs/), [Ruby](https://wedeploy.com/docs/deploy/deploying-ruby/) or [Java](https://wedeploy.com/docs/deploy/deploying-java/) app. You can deploy static files (think of GitHub Pages but faster). You can deploy a [Dockerfile](https://wedeploy.com/docs/deploy/deploying-docker/) and we automatically build it for you.

You can also deploy and use one of our services like [WeDeploy Auth](https://wedeploy.com/docs/auth/getting-started/) to authenticate users, [WeDeploy Data](https://wedeploy.com/docs/data/getting-started/) to save and consume data in real-time, and [WeDeploy Email](https://wedeploy.com/docs/email/getting-started/) to send emails asynchronously.

Basically, we're trying to combine everything that makes developers productive into one single platform.

Now you might be thinking: \*"sounds cool, **but how much does it cost?"\***

Since we're still in beta, **everything is free**. Our goal is for you to try it out, so we can get feedback and improve the platform. Once it's fully stable, we'll introduce pricing plans, but for **those who join now it will remain free**.

So go ahead, create an account, and [try it out](https://console.wedeploy.com)!

We can't wait to see what you're going to build :)
