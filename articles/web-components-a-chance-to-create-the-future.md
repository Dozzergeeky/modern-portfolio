Two weeks ago I was in San Francisco for [SFHTML5](http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/169452272/). This meetup was all about Polymer and I gave a talk called _"Web Components: a chance to create the future"_.

Slides are now available on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/zenorocha/web-components-a-chance-to-create-the-future) and the video is on YouTube.
