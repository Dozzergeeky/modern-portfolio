I always talk about getting out of the comfort zone, but a few weeks ago I looked at my side projects and noticed they all have two things in common:

1. they are made for developers
2. they are made for the web

In 2019 I want to try something new. I'll use my free time to create a mobile app for Android and iPhone where the audience is the consumer market.

I already have a prototype to show, so if you want to be a beta tester, please send a message.

The idea of the app is pretty simple, I'm going to share more details in the future, but just to give you a hint - the app is about cheese!
