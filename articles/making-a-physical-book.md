I can't believe this is real...

My book is now available in hardcover ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

- [English Edition](https://amazon.com/14-Habits-Highly-Productive-Developers/dp/1735266531)
- [Portuguese Edition](https://amazon.com.br/H%C3%A1bitos-Desenvolvedores-Altamente-Produtivos-Portuguese/dp/173526654X)

Building this physical copy has been a really intense process.

At first, I hired a person from Fiverr to do the entire formatting. After a lot of back and forth, I wasn't super happy with the quality, so I decided to do it myself.

You see, I know nothing about formatting books, but the internet is a magical place, so I started to learn Adobe InDesign.

After hours of adding content, choosing fonts, moving images, and optimizing line breaks, I was finally ready to print!

Before sending it to the publishing company, I decided to test everything at home using my good old printer. I made sure to read the entire book again to feel the experience on real paper. It's impressive how different it is.

I didn't want to order hundreds of copies and have them stored at my home. That's why I picked a service called IngramSpark, which is a print-on-demand publisher. This basically means that when someone buys a copy, they print and send it to you directly.

Designing a book is crazy because you have to make all these decisions like paperback vs. hardcover, white vs. creme paper, gloss vs. matte cover.

In the end, I chose hardcover since it's more durable and has a premium touch. I also chose creme paper since it's easier on the eyes. Once all those decisions were made, I pressed _Submit_ and waited a couple of weeks for the book to be produced.

I can't describe the feeling of receiving that first copy.

It's so amazing to see the words you wrote on real paper. To be honest, I never thought about writing a book, but now we have a digital book, an audio book, and now a physical book. Unbelievable.

I hope you enjoy this and thanks for all your support so far.

Grab your physical copy today or send it as a gift to a friend!
