Work is an interesting word. It means so many different things for different people. Some when they hear this word they might feel sad or happy, motivated or discouraged, passionated or obligated.

At the same time, work is such an abstract concept. If you're working for someone you're selling hours in exchange for money. If you're working for yourself it's not too much different.

What usually is the same are the reasons why we do it. We all want to provide for our families. We all want a meaning to be there.

It's very easy to get caught up on the routine. There's always meetings, projects, reviews, deadlines. So the first thing we do is to forget about yourselves. But we must remember to always have fun.

Always have fun.
