On May 20th, I made a presentation [Introducing Canvas, SVG & WebGL](https://github.com/zenorocha/talks/tree/master/2012/jsconf/)Â at [JSConf Latin America](http://jsconf.com.ar). I also wrote [an article (in portuguese)](/relato-jsconfar) telling how was my experience in Argentina. Well, now the video is online! \o/
