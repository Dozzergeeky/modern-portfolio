72 hours ago I launched [Dracula PRO](https://draculatheme.com/pro/).

It's been a crazy couple of days with tons of learnings.

Here are some thoughts and behind the scenes of this entire process.

## Conclusion #1

The landing page is the main driver for revenue.

Spending a lot of time refining your message always pays off.

## Conclusion #2

Here’s the geographical distribution of traffic this week.

The US alone has 23% of total traffic, that’s important to know especially when it comes to distributing content at the right timezone.

## Conclusion #3

I tried sharing on Reddit, Product Hunt, HackerNews, and IndieHackers.

Even though they brought some traffic, Twitter still is the number one referral source.

## Conclusion #4

- Net Sales are **$5,252.47** (after Gumroad fees, refunds, chargebacks, and affiliate fees);
- Total Costs are **$120.40** (Mailchimp, Typeform, etc);
- Net Profit: **$5,132.07**

Staying lean is very hard, but I’m focused on maintaining the operational costs as low as possible.

## Conclusion #5

Now I’m trying to think of ideas to keep the momentum going.

Any suggestions?
