I never thought I'd say this, but - yes - I just published a book!

**[14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers](https://14habits.com/) is now available for everyone.**

[![](/static/img/posts/i-just-launched-a-book.jpg)](https://14habits.com/)

It's everything I know about productivity, tech career, and side projects into one package. I spent 3 months writing this, 1 month working on the launch, and 10+ years living these ideas.

To be honest, I never wanted to write a book, but I believe that being a developer is more than knowing the hottest tools.

You can learn the most popular frameworks, use the best programming languages, and work at the biggest tech companies, but if you cultivate bad habits, it will be hard for you to become a top developer.

Because of that, I decided to reach out to the best developers I know and ask them tips on how to be more productive.

I went after tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Powerful startups such as Spotify, GoDaddy, and Shopify. All the way to established organizations such as Citibank and The New York Times.

This book is a collection of valuable learnings not only from me but from experienced programmers from all over the world.

I hope you like it :)

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm here to answer every single one of them.
